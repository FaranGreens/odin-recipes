    <h2 class="desc heading">Description</h2>
    <p id="description">My Norwegian grandmother made this for us as a treat, and it continues to be a favorite my mother makes for my kids. Very easy and versatile. Serve rolled like a crepe with syrup or jam. Can also be a dessert stuffed with a sweetened cream cheese and lingon berry mixture.

<h2 class="ingr heading">Ingredients</h2>
<ul class="ingr">
    <li>3 eggs</li>
    <li>1 ½ cups milk</li>
    <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
</ul>

    <li>Combine the eggs and milk in the container of a blender. Add the flour, salt and sugar, and blend until smooth.

    </li>
    <li>Heat a skillet over medium-high heat, and coat with cooking spray or butter. Scoop about 1/4 cup of batter into the skillet, and tilt the pan to coat the bottom. Cook until the top looks dry, about 30 seconds. Carefully slide a spatula under the pancake and flip. Cook for a few seconds on the other side, just until browned. Remove to a plate, and repeat with remaining batter.
